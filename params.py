    parameters -- python dictionary containing your parameters "W1", "b1", ..., "WL", "bL":

    Tips:
    - For example: the layer_dims for the "Planar Data classification model" would have been [2,2,1]. 
    This means W1's shape was (2,2), b1 was (1,2), W2 was (2,1) and b2 was (1,1). Now you have to generalize it!
    - In the for loop, use parameters['W' + str(l)] to access Wl, where l is the iterative integer.
